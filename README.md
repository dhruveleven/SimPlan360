# SimPlan360

> A Smart Scenario-Based Financial Planning Simulator for Individuals

SimPlan360 is a highly interactive web-based tool designed to help users simulate and compare multiple long-term personal finance scenarios, accounting for variables like income, inflation, expenses, risk tolerance, debt, and market growth. The project lays the foundation for intelligent financial decision-making using future enhancements like Monte Carlo simulations and AI-based advisory.

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 **Input-Rich Form**: Users can simulate two different financial paths by entering key variables.
- 📈 **Dynamic Visualizations**: Uses Chart.js to plot savings growth year by year.
- 💡 **Smart Comparison Engine**: Instantly compares two scenarios and highlights the better outcome.
- 💼 **Business-Ready Variables**:
  - Income, raises, and inflation
  - Expenses, EMI, and debt
  - Risk tolerance and economic shock factors
